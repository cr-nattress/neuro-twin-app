# Problem-Solver Analysis Agent

Analyze problem-solving approaches and thinking patterns to create comprehensive cognitive profiles and problem-solver type definitions.

## Core Purpose

This skill analyzes how you solve problems — cognitively, emotionally, and strategically — by recognizing consistent thought patterns across technical, creative, and interpersonal contexts. It evaluates:

- **Cognitive structure**: How you organize and process complexity
- **Problem-solving orientation**: Analytical, intuitive, experimental, or hybrid
- **Decision-making process**: Data-driven, value-driven, iterative, or synthetic
- **Adaptability and reflection**: How you learn and revise strategy
- **Motivational drivers**: Why you approach problems the way you do
- **Emotional and interpersonal style**: How you operate under challenge

## Analysis Framework

The skill examines you across these dimensions:

### 1. Cognitive Structure
How you organize and process complexity, handle information overload, and build mental models.

### 2. Problem-Solving Orientation
Whether you tend toward:
- **Analytical**: Breaking things down, data-driven, systematic
- **Intuitive**: Pattern recognition, gut feel, big-picture thinking
- **Experimental**: Trial-and-error, prototyping, learning by doing
- **Synthetic**: Combining approaches, finding novel solutions

### 3. Decision-Making Process
Your typical sequence:
- Data gathering and analysis
- Value assessment and priorities
- Iterative refinement vs. decisive action
- Integration of diverse perspectives

### 4. Adaptability & Reflection
How you respond when plans fail or conditions change:
- Mechanisms for regaining control or clarity
- How quickly you pivot
- Whether you learn from mistakes

### 5. Motivational Drivers
Why you approach problems the way you do:
- What energizes you
- What frustrates you
- What values guide your decisions

### 6. Emotional & Interpersonal Style
How you operate when challenged:
- Stress responses
- Communication under pressure
- Collaboration style

## Output Format

Generate a comprehensive **Problem-Solving Style Report** with these sections:

### Executive Summary (5-6 sentences)
Describe who you are as a thinker:
- Your default cognitive lens
- How you handle uncertainty
- Your general mental operating system

### Problem-Solving Framework
Outline how you typically approach challenges:
- Recognition → Analysis → Action → Reflection
- Describe as repeatable mental algorithm with short phases
- Example: "Map → Dissect → Model → Iterate → Refine"

### Cognitive Traits (6 bullets)
Six defining traits of your problem-solving style:
- Each with one-sentence behavioral example
- Grounded in observed patterns
- Clear and memorable

### Adaptive Strategies
Explain how you respond when plans fail or conditions change:
- Mechanisms you use
- How you regain control
- Mental shifts you employ

### Biases & Blind Spots
Highlight 2-3 cognitive biases or recurring patterns:
- How they distort reasoning
- Practical counter-strategy for each
- Self-aware and actionable

### Strength Profile
Summarize top strengths as a problem-solver:
- Examples: Synthesis, pattern recognition, abstraction, emotional regulation
- How these manifest in your work
- How to leverage them

### Problem-Solver Type Definition
Assign a concise type name:
- Examples: "The Systemic Innovator", "The Reflective Strategist", "The Pragmatic Architect"
- Describe how this type perceives problems
- How they structure solutions
- How they resolve challenges

### How to Work With This Type (Optional)
Practical advice for collaborators or leaders:
- What to leverage
- What to avoid
- How this person operates best
- Communication preferences

## Analysis Principles

**Extract and infer from available data**:
- ChatGPT conversations
- Project descriptions
- Communication patterns
- Code structure and style
- Decision histories

**Recognize consistent patterns**:
- How do you typically start problems?
- What approaches do you return to?
- What frustrates you?
- How do you handle failure?

**Be psychologically grounded**:
- Use behavioral psychology concepts
- Root inferences in observable patterns
- Avoid stereotyping or assumptions
- Consider context and constraints

**Write with precision and insight**:
- Use natural, confident language
- Avoid clinical jargon
- Make observations memorable
- Ground in concrete examples

## Example Output Structure

# Problem-Solving Style Report

## Type: The Reflective Architect

### Executive Summary
This person decomposes complexity into elegant frameworks. They think in systems first,
details second. Their method is recursive — observe, abstract, refine, implement — with
feedback loops built into every decision. They value elegance and integrity over speed,
preferring precision to improvisation.

### Framework
Map → Abstract → Model → Test → Reflect → Improve

### Key Traits
- Analytical empathy (understands technical and human dimensions)
- Logical thinking with meta-awareness (questions assumptions)
- Deliberate iteration (refines multiple times)
- Strategic calm (maintains clarity under pressure)
- Skepticism toward assumptions (questions before accepting)
- Preference for elegant solutions (chooses style and substance)

### Adaptive Strategies
When a plan fails, you typically step back to reassess assumptions rather than
immediately pivoting. You look for the pattern in the failure — what violated your
mental model? This reflection is your strength when conditions change.

### Biases & Blind Spots
1. **Over-architecture**: Can over-design solutions before validating needs
   - Counter: Set strict time limits for design phases, validate early
2. **Perfectionism**: May delay execution waiting for elegant solutions
   - Counter: Use "good enough" timers, iterate in public
3. **Assumption blind spots**: Can overlook simple solutions while seeking elegant ones
   - Counter: Explicitly ask "What's the simplest way?"

### Strengths
- Systems thinking and pattern recognition
- Ability to see long-term implications
- Communication of complex ideas
- Teaching and mentoring others

### Best Team Role
Architect, technical lead, or strategic advisor. You excel at helping teams
see the big picture and make decisions that scale.
